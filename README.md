# Aleksey Pimkin - Data Analytic - Portfolio
In this repository I would like to show Data Analytics project I performed to introduce skills and overall vision of data storytelling 

## [Project 1: SLA Dashboard aka Process Minig Dashboard](https://github.com/too314m/SLA-Dashboard)
### SLA Dashboard that estimates downtime of business processes on every step to show to management bottle neck and real overall picture of how business flow goes.
- Interview of Process Owners to get "how-is-it" workflow and document it by draw.io
- Extraction and Transformation of business process Logs by SQL
- Load logs to Decisions Process Mining tool to analyse "how-it-is" workflow and compare it with "how-is-it"
- Extract additional parameters for log events by SQL
- Load data to Power BI and compile a relational Data Model by DAX and Power Query
- Develop an approach to visualise valuable instancies: create a succinct definitions list, deduction as a way to order visuals by Freeform / MindNode
- Develop a design solution to correctly place data accents by Figma
- Create a visualization by Power BI
- Manage Row Level Security for different groups of users
- Analyse developed dashboard to get insights of an issue analyzing
- Presentation to reporter by Keynote / PowerPoint
- Getting feedback
- Built automative scheduled email reporting system by Power Automate flow development

## [Project 2: KPI Dashboard](https://github.com/too314m/KPI_Dashboard)
### KPI Dashboard to estimate Department Performance over a time period based on PC activity, Communication activity and actual job done.
- Interview of Process Owners to get "how-is-it" workflow and document it by draw.io
- Built data extraction and collection process from 5 sources to store it in DWH by importing .csv via SQL and scrapping by python via API. Also manage update / archivation approach and schedule
- Load all data to Power BI and Transform it by Power Query and DAX
- Manage design and visualization to maximize efficiency of dashboard for end-user
- As a part of Summary page we used Stephen Few best practice visualization by table with sparklinec and conditional formating
- Analyze worflow and adjust the report for better UX
- Present developed tool and found insights to requester
- Set a scheduled refresh for Power BI Dataset

## [Project 3: Super Scatterplot](https://github.com/too314m/SuperScatterplot)
### Creation a powerfull tool by using default Power BI features only to assess every team performance (Advanced Scatterplot)
- Create basic Scatter plot in Power BI
- Create a Parameter for each Axis and set it as constant line to separate the scatter by 4 quadrants
- By parameter's slicer, create possibility to manually adjust quadrants - ability to model a different scenarios in Analysis
- Add a Field Parameters of Quadrant Number, Sales Team and Project Manager
- Add createed Field Parameter as a Legend of Scatterplot so now it's possible to change color scheme
- Additionally put all three field as a Slicers - add possibility to filter data by these categories and see results in different color legend ways
- Extra step - to copy each slicer and change its visual type to a barchart. Put every barchart under correspondent slicer so we can see actual color of category we would like to filter
- Create a measure to hide such barchart of slicers which are not selected in Field Parameters
- Enjoy powerfull and pretty tool for your Analysis
